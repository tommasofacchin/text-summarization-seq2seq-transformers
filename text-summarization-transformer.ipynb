It’s widely used in tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and chatbots.\n","\n","**Example:**  \n","Input: \"Hello, how are you?\"  \n","Output: \"Ciao, come stai?\"\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Encoder-Decoder Architecture (Expanded)\n","\n","A typical Seq2Seq model has two main parts: the **encoder** and the **decoder**. The design allows the model to process sequences of variable length.  \n","\n","### Encoder\n","The encoder reads the input sequence and compresses it into a set of hidden states or a context vector. This vector captures the important information from the input and has a fixed size, though it does not need to match the decoder's size. The hidden states can either be passed as a whole to the decoder or connected at every decoding step.  \n","\n","At each step, the encoder updates its hidden state based on the previous hidden state and the current input. In mathematical terms, for a simple RNN:\n","\n","$$\n","H_t^{encoder} = \\phi(W_{HH} \\cdot H_{t-1}^{encoder} + W_{HX} \\cdot X_t)\n","$$\n","\n","Where:  \n","- $H_t^{encoder}$ = hidden state at time $t$ in the encoder  \n","- $X_t$ = input at time $t$  \n","- $W_{HH}$ = weight matrix connecting hidden states  \n","- $W_{HX}$ = weight matrix connecting input to hidden states  \n","- $\\phi$ = activation function (e.g., tanh or ReLU)\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Decoder\n","The decoder generates the output sequence one token at a time. Its initial hidden state is set to the final hidden state of the encoder. For a simple RNN decoder:\n","\n","$$\n","H_t^{decoder} = \\phi(W_{HH} \\cdot H_{t-1}^{decoder} + W_{HY} \\cdot Y_{t-1})\n","$$\n","\n","The output at each step is computed as:\n","\n","$$\n","Y_t = W_{HY} \\cdot H_t^{decoder}\n","$$\n","\n","Where:  \n","- $H_t^{decoder}$ = hidden state at time $t$ in the decoder  \n","- $Y_t$ = output at time $t$  \n","- $W_{HY}$ = weight matrix connecting decoder hidden state to output  \n","\n","### Implementation Notes\n","- Encoders and decoders are typically implemented with **RNNs, LSTMs, or GRUs**.  \n","- The input and output vectors are of fixed size, but the encoder and decoder can have different hidden dimensions.  \n","- During training, **teacher forcing** is often used, providing the correct previous token to the decoder instead of its own prediction.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## Tokenization\n","\n","Before feeding text into a Seq2Seq or Transformer model, the raw text must be converted into numerical form.  \n","This is done through **tokenization**, which splits text into smaller units (tokens) such as words or subwords.  \n","\n","Each token is then mapped to a unique integer using a **vocabulary** built from the dataset.  \n","The model processes these integers rather than the raw text.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","\n","Input text: `\"Transformers improve summarization.\"`  \n","Tokens: `[\"transformers\", \"improve\", \"summarization\", \".\"]`  \n","Token IDs: `[201, 57, 1342, 4]`\n","\n","### Why Tokenization Matters\n","- Converts variable-length text into consistent, model-readable sequences.  \n","- Helps capture word frequency and context relationships.  \n","- Reduces vocabulary size when using subword tokenization (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding).  \n","\n","In this project, tokenization is part of preprocessing and includes:\n","- **Lowercasing** the text  \n","- **Removing special characters and URLs**  \n","- **Splitting into tokens by spaces**  \n","- Adding **start (`sostok`)** and **end (`eostok`)** tokens to mark summary boundaries  \n","\n","After tokenization, sequences will later be converted to integer IDs, padded or truncated to a fixed length\n","\n","---\n","\n","# Transformers\n","Transformers can be seen as an evolution of Seq2Seq models. Instead of processing sequences step by step like LSTMs or GRUs, they rely entirely on **attention mechanisms** to process all tokens in parallel and capture relationships between them.\n","\n","### Attention in Transformers\n","Attention is the core mechanism that allows Transformers to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when producing a representation for each token. It works by comparing each token to all others and weighting them according to importance.\n","\n","#### How Attention Works\n","Each token in the sequence is represented by three vectors:\n","- **Query (Q):** what this token is looking for  \n","- **Key (K):** what information this token contains  \n","- **Value (V):** the actual information of the token  \n","\n","The attention score between two tokens is computed as the similarity between the Query of one token and the Key of another. This determines how much attention one token should pay to another. Mathematically, the attention weights are computed using a scaled dot-product:\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\Big(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\Big) V\n","$$\n","\n","Where $d_k$ is the dimensionality of the Key vectors.\n","\n","- The **softmax** ensures that the weights sum to 1.  \n","- Each token’s output is a weighted sum of all Value vectors, allowing it to incorporate context from the entire sequence.\n","\n","#### Multi-Head Attention\n","Instead of computing attention just once, Transformers use **multiple attention heads** in parallel. Each head can learn to focus on different types of relationships, such as:\n","- Syntactic relationships (e.g., subject-verb connections)  \n","- Semantic relationships (e.g., synonyms or related concepts)  \n","\n","The outputs of all heads are concatenated and projected to form the final representation for each token.\n","\n","#### Intuition\n","Imagine reading a sentence and highlighting all the words that are important for understanding each token. Each word “attends” to other words in the sentence that matter most for its meaning. Multi-head attention lets the model do this from multiple perspectives simultaneously.\n","\n","### Key Components of Transformers\n","- **Encoder-Decoder Structure:** Like Seq2Seq models, Transformers have an encoder that processes the input and a decoder that generates the output. Both use layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks.  \n","- **Positional Encoding:** Since Transformers don’t process tokens sequentially, they add positional information so the model knows the order of tokens.  \n","- **Feed-Forward Layers:** After attention, each token passes through fully connected layers for additional transformation.\n","\n","### Advantages over LSTM/GRU Seq2Seq\n","- Processes sequences **in parallel**, speeding up training.  \n","- Handles **long sequences** more effectively with attention.  \n","- Captures **complex relationships** between tokens regardless of distance.  \n","- Scales easily to **very deep models** and large datasets.\n","\n","### Use Cases\n","Transformers are the backbone of many state-of-the-art models for tasks such as:\n","- Machine translation (e.g., T5, MarianMT)  \n","- Text summarization (e.g., BART, Pegasus)  \n","- Question answering and chatbots (e.g., GPT, BERT-based models)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"fe1ca57e","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-23T16:07:49.130114Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-23T16:07:49.129843Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-23T16:07:55.966264Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-23T16:07:55.965295Z"},"papermill":{"duration":6.842467,"end_time":"2025-12-23T16:07:55.967499","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-12-23T16:07:49.125032","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: sentencepiece in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (0.2.0)\r\n","Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.\n","Requirement already satisfied: openpyxl in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (3.1.5)\r\n","Requirement already satisfied: et-xmlfile in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from openpyxl) (2.0.0)\r\n","Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.\n"]}],"source":["%pip install sentencepiece\n","%pip install openpyxl"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c291fc53","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.004133,"end_time":"2025-12-23T16:07:55.976185","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-12-23T16:07:55.972052","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Data Preparation\n","\n","Prepare and clean the dataset for the summarization model:\n","\n","- **Load datasets:** Read two CSV files containing news articles and their summaries.\n","- **Combine datasets:** Merge datasets while selecting relevant `text` and `summary` columns.\n","- **Text cleaning:**  \n","  -

The main benefit is consistency: the encoder and decoder operate on the same vocabulary and token representations, which makes cross-attention easier to learn and stabilizes training. The model does not need to internally translate between two different symbolic systems, so convergence is faster and behavior is more predictable. A shared tokenizer also reduces the total number of parameters, avoids duplicated tokens, and improves generalization, especially for named entities, numbers, and rare words that appear in both input and output. Debugging is simpler because there is only one source of truth for tokenization.\n","\n","The main drawback is that a single tokenizer is a compromise between two different distributions. Input texts are long and diverse, while summaries are short and dense. A shared vocabulary may allocate capacity to tokens that are useful for the input but rarely needed in the output, slightly reducing efficiency. It also offers less control over the style and structure of the generated summaries compared to using a specialized tokenizer for the output. In addition, special tokens such as start and end markers must be handled carefully to avoid interfering with the encoder input.\n","\n","In practice, a single tokenizer is usually the better choice for summarization, translation, and other sequence-to-sequence tasks, especially with small or medium datasets and custom or experimental tokenizers.
