    "# Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on **text summarization** using two approaches: a traditional **Seq2Seq model** with LSTM and a **Transformer-based model**. The goal is to see how each model performs and understand the difference between step-by-step sequence processing and attention-based processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps in the Project\n",
    "1. **Dataset Preparation**  \n",
    "   - Load the XSum dataset with articles and summaries.  \n",
    "   - Tokenize and pad sequences so they can be fed into the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Seq2Seq Model (LSTM)**  \n",
    "   - Build an encoder-decoder model without attention.\n",
    "   - Train it to generate summaries from the input articles.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transformer Model**  \n",
    "   - Build a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model.  \n",
    "   - Use self-attention to capture relationships between all tokens.  \n",
    "   - Train on the same dataset to generate summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparison**  \n",
    "   - Compare the two models using metrics like ROUGE.  \n",
    "   - Look at differences in summary quality, speed, and how well they handle long sequences.\n"

    "# Seq2Seq and Encoder-Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Seq2Seq Model\n",
    "A sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model is designed to take an input sequence and produce an output sequence. It’s widely used in tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "Input: \"Hello, how are you?\"  \n",
    "Output: \"Ciao, come stai?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encoder-Decoder Architecture (Expanded)\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical Seq2Seq model has two main parts: the **encoder** and the **decoder**. The design allows the model to process sequences of variable length.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoder\n",
    "The encoder reads the input sequence and compresses it into a set of hidden states or a context vector. This vector captures the important information from the input and has a fixed size, though it does not need to match the decoder's size. The hidden states can either be passed as a whole to the decoder or connected at every decoding step.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, the encoder updates its hidden state based on the previous hidden state and the current input. In mathematical terms, for a simple RNN:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_t^{encoder} = \\phi(W_{HH} \\cdot H_{t-1}^{encoder} + W_{HX} \\cdot X_t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:  \n",
    "- $H_t^{encoder}$ = hidden state at time $t$ in the encoder  \n",
    "- $X_t$ = input at time $t$  \n",
    "- $W_{HH}$ = weight matrix connecting hidden states  \n",
    "- $W_{HX}$ = weight matrix connecting input to hidden states  \n",
    "- $\\phi$ = activation function (e.g., tanh or ReLU)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoder\n",
    "The decoder generates the output sequence one token at a time. Its initial hidden state is set to the final hidden state of the encoder. For a simple RNN decoder:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_t^{decoder} = \\phi(W_{HH} \\cdot H_{t-1}^{decoder} + W_{HY} \\cdot Y_{t-1})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The output at each step is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_t = W_{HY} \\cdot H_t^{decoder}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:  \n",
    "- $H_t^{decoder}$ = hidden state at time $t$ in the decoder  \n",
    "- $Y_t$ = output at time $t$  \n",
    "- $W_{HY}$ = weight matrix connecting decoder hidden state to output  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Notes\n",
    "- Encoders and decoders are typically implemented with **RNNs, LSTMs, or GRUs**.  \n",
    "- The input and output vectors are of fixed size, but the encoder and decoder can have different hidden dimensions.  \n",
    "- During training, **teacher forcing** is often used, providing the correct previous token to the decoder instead of its own prediction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "Before feeding text into a Seq2Seq or Transformer model, the raw text must be converted into numerical form.  \n",
    "This is done through **tokenization**, which splits text into smaller units (tokens) such as words or subwords.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each token is then mapped to a unique integer using a **vocabulary** built from the dataset.  \n",
    "The model processes these integers rather than the raw text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input text: `\"Transformers improve summarization.\"`  \n",
    "Tokens: `[\"transformers\", \"improve\", \"summarization\", \".\"]`  \n",
    "Token IDs: `[201, 57, 1342, 4]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Tokenization Matters\n",
    "- Converts variable-length text into consistent, model-readable sequences.  \n",
    "- Helps capture word frequency and context relationships.  \n",
    "- Reduces vocabulary size when using subword tokenization (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, tokenization is part of preprocessing and includes:\n",
    "- **Lowercasing** the text  \n",
    "- **Removing special characters and URLs**  \n",
    "- **Splitting into tokens by spaces**  \n",
    "- Adding **start (`sostok`)** and **end (`eostok`)** tokens to mark summary boundaries  \n",
    "\n",
    "After tokenization, sequences will later be converted to integer IDs, padded or truncated to a fixed length\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Transformers\n",
    "Transformers can be seen as an evolution of Seq2Seq models. Instead of processing sequences step by step like LSTMs or GRUs, they rely entirely on **attention mechanisms** to process all tokens in parallel and capture relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attention in Transformers\n",
    "Attention is the core mechanism that allows Transformers to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when producing a representation for each token. It works by comparing each token to all others and weighting them according to importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Attention Works\n",
    "Each token in the sequence is represented by three vectors:\n",
    "- **Query (Q):** what this token is looking for  \n",
    "- **Key (K):** what information this token contains  \n",
    "- **Value (V):** the actual information of the token  \n",
    "\n",
    "The attention score between two tokens is computed as the similarity between the Query of one token and the Key of another. This determines how much attention one token should pay to another. Mathematically, the attention weights are computed using a scaled dot-product:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\Big(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\Big) V\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $d_k$ is the dimensionality of the Key vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **softmax** ensures that the weights sum to 1.  \n",
    "- Each token’s output is a weighted sum of all Value vectors, allowing it to incorporate context from the entire sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "Instead of computing attention just once, Transformers use **multiple attention heads** in parallel. Each head can learn to focus on different types of relationships, such as:\n",
    "- Syntactic relationships (e.g., subject-verb connections)  \n",
    "- Semantic relationships (e.g., synonyms or related concepts)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs of all heads are concatenated and projected to form the final representation for each token.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intuition\n",
    "Imagine reading a sentence and highlighting all the words that are important for understanding each token. Each word “attends” to other words in the sentence that matter most for its meaning. Multi-head attention lets the model do this from multiple perspectives simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of Transformers\n",
    "- **Encoder-Decoder Structure:** Like Seq2Seq models, Transformers have an encoder that processes the input and a decoder that generates the output. Both use layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks.  \n",
    "- **Positional Encoding:** Since Transformers don’t process tokens sequentially, they add positional information so the model knows the order of tokens.  \n",
    "- **Feed-Forward Layers:** After attention, each token passes through fully connected layers for additional transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages over LSTM/GRU Seq2Seq\n",
    "- Processes sequences **in parallel**, speeding up training.  \n",
    "- Handles **long sequences** more effectively with attention.  \n",
    "- Captures **complex relationships** between tokens regardless of distance.  \n",
    "- Scales easily to **very deep models** and large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "Transformers are the backbone of many state-of-the-art models for tasks such as:\n",
    "- Machine translation (e.g., T5, MarianMT)  \n",
    "- Text summarization (e.g., BART, Pegasus)  \n",
    "- Question answering and chatbots (e.g., GPT, BERT-based models)"

In this connection, all offices/ departments shall remain open and celebrate the festival collectively at a suitable time wherein all the lady staff shall tie rakhis to their colleagues,? the order, issued on August 1 by Gurpreet Singh, deputy secretary (personnel), had said.To ensure that no one skipped office, an attendance report was to be sent to the government the next evening.The two notifications ? one mandating the celebration of Rakshabandhan (left) and the other withdrawing the mandate (right) ? were issued by the Daman and Diu administration a day apart. The circular was withdrawn through a one-line order issued late in the evening by the UT?s department of personnel and administrative reforms.?The circular is ridiculous. There are sensitivities involved. How can the government dictate who I should tie rakhi to? We should maintain the professionalism of a workplace? an official told Hindustan Times earlier in the day. She refused to be identified.The notice was issued on Daman and Diu administrator and former Gujarat home minister Praful Kodabhai Patel?s direction, sources said.Rakshabandhan, a celebration of the bond between brothers and sisters, is one of several Hindu festivities and rituals that are no longer confined of private, family affairs but have become tools to push politic al ideologies.In 2014, the year BJP stormed to power at the Centre, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said the festival had ?national significance? and should be celebrated widely ?to protect Hindu culture and live by the values enshrined in it?. The RSS is the ideological parent of the ruling BJP.Last year, women ministers in the Modi government went to the border areas to celebrate the festival with soldiers. A year before, all cabinet ministers were asked to go to their constituencies for the festival.</td>\n",

       "0  The Daman and Diu administration on Wednesday withdrew a circular that asked women staff to tie rakhis on male colleagues after the order triggered a backlash from employees and was ripped apart on social media.The union territory?s administration was forced to retreat within 24 hours of issuing the circular that made it compulsory for its staff to celebrate Rakshabandhan at workplace.?It has been decided to celebrate the festival of Rakshabandhan on August 7. In this connection, all offices/ departments shall remain open and celebrate the festival collectively at a suitable time wherein all the lady staff shall tie rakhis to their colleagues,? the order, issued on August 1 by Gurpreet Singh, deputy secretary (personnel), had said.To ensure that no one skipped office, an attendance report was to be sent to the government the next evening.The two notifications ? one mandating the celebration of Rakshabandhan (left) and the other withdrawing the mandate (right) ? were issued by the Daman and Diu administration a day apart. The circular was withdrawn through a one-line order issued late in the evening by the UT?s department of personnel and administrative reforms.?The circular is ridiculous. There are sensitivities involved. How can the government dictate who I should tie rakhi to? We should maintain the professionalism of a workplace? an official told Hindustan Times earlier in the day. She refused to be identified.The notice was issued on Daman and Diu administrator and former Gujarat home minister Praful Kodabhai Patel?s direction, sources said.Rakshabandhan, a celebration of the bond between brothers and sisters, is one of several Hindu festivities and rituals that are no longer confined of private, family affairs but have become tools to push politic al ideologies.In 2014, the year BJP stormed to power at the Centre, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said the festival had ?national significance? and should be celebrated widely ?to protect Hindu culture and live by the values enshrined in it?. The RSS is the ideological parent of the ruling BJP.Last year, women ministers in the Modi government went to the border areas to celebrate the festival with soldiers. A year before, all cabinet ministers were asked to go to their constituencies for the festival.  "

    "\n",
    "During training, the model takes **two inputs**:  \n",

    "2. The decoder input (`summary`) – the summary shifted by one token.  \n",

    "- The embedded input is processed by one or more **Multi-Head Self-Attention** blocks:\n",
    "  - Each word attends to **all other words** in the input\n",

    "  2. **Encoder-Decoder Attention**: allows the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the input article.\n",

It does not capture semantic meaning, fluency, word order, or relevance, and it can be inflated by common tokens like padding or start/end markers. A model can have high accuracy while producing poor summaries. Better evaluation uses metrics like ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L, which measure overlap of unigrams, bigrams, and longest common subsequences between generated and reference summaries. During training, it is better to monitor validation loss and evaluate summaries qualitatively or with ROUGE rather than relying on token accuracy."
